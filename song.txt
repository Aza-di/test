ooh, yeeeaaa, ooh
cmon, cmon
i see no changes
wake up in tha mornin and i ask myself
is life worth livin or should i blast myself?
im tired of bein poor, and even worse, im black, my stomach hurts
so im lookin for a purse to snatch
cops give a damn about a negro
pull tha trigga, kill a nigga hes a hero
give tha crack to the kids who the hell cares
one less hungry mouth on welfare
first ship em dope, that im dealin brothas
give em guns step back watch em kill each other
its time to fight back thats what huey said
2 shots in the dark now hueys dead
i got love for my brotha but we could neva go nowhere
unless we share wit each otha
we gotta start makin changes
learn to see me as a brotha instead of 2 distant strangas
and thats how its sposed to be
how could the devil take a brotha if hes close to me
uh, i'd love to go back to when we played as kids
but thangs changed
and thats the way it is
cmon, cmon
thats just the way it is
thangs will never be tha same
thats just the way it is
aw yeah
and yeah
oh my, oh my
thats just the way it is
thangs will never be tha same, neva be tha same yea yea yea
aw yea, thats just the way it is
aw yea
